This project is based on song Genre Classification using CNN.
It contains 10 music genres.

# Dataset
I gathered the dataset from GTZAN genre collection, link for the same is: http://marsyas.info/downloads/datasets.html
The dataset is approximately 1.2GB, each genre has 100 audio clips in .wav format, so the total is 10 x 100 = 1000 audio set.
